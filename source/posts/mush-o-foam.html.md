##Mush-o-foam? NOT Styrofoam

We all come into contact with Styrofoam as packaging for electronics, furniture or kitchen
gadgets. When we are finished using it for packaging it goes into the recycle bin (if we are
lucky) or directly to the landfill – where it can hang around for 10,000 years!
And there is an alternative that can still protect our computers or TVs in transit but doesn’t
pollute the land or ocean; MUSHROOM MYCELIUM! Yes, we can grow an eco-friendly packaging
material. Mycelium is the fibrous underground part of the mushroom and is an important part
of nature’s recycling system

The way it works is 1) start with an agricultural by-product, like oat husks, 2)prepare the husks
by sterilizing them, 3) add mushroom spores that love to digest oat husks, 4)put the husks and
the mushroom in a mold in the shape of the final packaging material, 5) wait a week for the
mushroom mycelium to grow, 6) take the final product out of the mold. The new material is
tough, impact absorbing, fire resistant and light. And it can be thrown into the compost when
we are finished using it!

Ikea is using ‘Ecocradle’ mushroom mycelium packaging materials; check out

Let’s ask all the manufacturers to use mycelium packaging!
