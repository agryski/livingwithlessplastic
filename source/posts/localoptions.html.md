##Who is helping you in ‘Living with Less Plastic’?

To celebrate the changes that are happening in our communities, we are making a list of places
and businesses who are using less plastic. So, if you know of a restaurant that allows you to bring
your own containers for take-out, let me know! I’ll keep track of stores that are selling
cucumbers without the plastic wrap, or are stocking tooth powder in boxes or tins, as well as
the standard toothpaste in plastic tubes.

Beeswax cloths for replacing plastic cling wrap for food.
Brands differ by ingredients (whether they include tree resin, for example) and the type of cloth
(some use organic cotton while some utilize a cotton linen mix). Beetomee says the cloths will
last a year if well cared for.
Amazon: Lists 4 different brands, including Abeego: Beeswax Food Wrap, Honeywrap, Abeego
and Beetomee.

The Abeego brand is available at:
*Gardenworks Marine Drive, Burnaby
*Canteen &amp; Supply, 810 Quayside Drive, New Westminster
*Eden West Fine Foods, 96 Kyle St, Port Moody
*Walmart

Drop me a line to let me know about either your experience with beeswax cloths or finding a
restaurant that lets you use your own containers for take-out… ! <lessplasticnewwest@gmail.com>
