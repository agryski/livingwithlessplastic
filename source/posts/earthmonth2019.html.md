##Plastic Groceries: We are speaking out!

We have approached Save-On Foods (Columbia Street), Choices Market (10 th Avenue), and Safeway (McBride)
for help with plastic-free options. Specifically, we want to be able to bring our own containers for bulk products, to
suggest a ‘plastics-free’ aisle as a place to start, and to change buying incentives that require
you to purchase apples, for example, in a plastic bag in order to qualify for a lower price.

Supermarkets are slow to get the message, but the furor is building! Greenpeace is collecting
signatures on their petitions to increase the plastics-free options in grocery stores (100,000
signatures went to Trader Joe’s) and you can add your voice to the clamour. [Sign the
Greenpeace petition here]

For a great overview of the plastic groceries situation in Canada (including some inspiring
examples from a British grocery store) watch the recent [CBC Marketplace video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5Qbi_dB3Qo)

Plant-based packaging solutions [do exist](https://www.id8agency.com/blog/2018/04/27/five-
plant-based-materials-for-sustainable-packaging/) and offer exciting options for replacing, for
example, plastic wrap. There are additional considerations for us to address, such as how to
get the cellulose film back into the compost, whether we should be growing plants for
packaging rather than food, and how to prevent contamination of plastics that truly are headed
for recycling. Food for thought!

And check out the Trader Joe announcement of their response to the Greenpeace petition
