One way that individuals can reduce their plastic use is by making things from scratch.

Raw ingredients such as flour, oats, salt, yeast, and baking soda are some of the easiest grocery items to find in paper or glass packaging.

## The Basic Recipe

A simpe bread consists of flour, water, salt, and yeast.

- 488g flour (of which 150g whole wheat)
- 3/4 tsp salt
- 3/4 tsp instant yeast
- 328ml water 

Mix all the dry ingredients in a bowl.

Add the water.  It should feel "wet" warm (neither hot nor cold).

Mix together into a rough dough. This step should take 1-2 minutes.

Let it rest (or autolyse) for 20 minutes.  This will make the kneading easier.

Knead for 30 seconds, let rest for 10 minutes, then knead for 1-2 minutes until it forms into a smooth ball.

Leave your dough to rise in the bowl, covered with a damp tea towel for 90 minutes.

After this, your dough should have doubled in size and you can shape into a loaf.  A simple round boule can be cooked on a baking sheet or in a pie dish or you can shape the dough into a loaf pan.

Cover your shaped loaf with a damp tea towel and leave to rise (or proof) for 45 minutes to an hour.

If you want to slash the top of the loaf, do so immediately before putting it in the oven.

Bake your loaf at 400F for 40 minutes.

Remove from the pan to a cooling rack and let cool.
