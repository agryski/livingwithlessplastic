##Plastic at the Grocery Store

Are you concerned about the amount of plastic you ‘buy’ when you do your grocery shopping?
Produce in plastic wrap, bread in plastic bags, dairy products in plastic tubs, meat on black
plastic trays? You already take your cloth shopping bags &amp; produce bags. You already choose
products that have less packaging. However, there is a limit to the options you have if your
grocery store doesn’t stock many ‘plastic-free’ products.

We know that non-plastic packaging options exist (cardboard, paper, plant-based wrapping
film, using reusable containers). We know that grocery stores can ask their suppliers to use the
greener options. Here are some things that can be done:

1. Contact the chain’s head office
2. Share the names of ‘green’ grocery stores
3. Let the stockers and the cashier know that we are looking for ‘less packaging’ options
4. follow Zero Waste Canada
5. support farmers markets and local producers
6. use fewer prepared foods by making our own versions

Greenpeace Canada has an 
[Action Toolkit](https://act.greenpeace.org/page/22385/petition/2#toolkit) that includes reducing single-use
plastic (SUP) in supermarkets. One of the actions recommended is to unpack the groceries
before you leave the store and take all the plastic to the Customer Service counter, letting them
know that you want plastic-free options. Another action suggestion is to take as many re-usable containers 
(jars, cans, bags) as you can. This can be tricky since some of the chains have
internal policies that preclude use of your own containers.

What do we want supermarkets to do? (from the Greenpeace Action Toolkit)

1. Create a single-use plastic reduction policy and transition plan that includes social
responsibility considerations
2. Phase out single-use plastic packaging (e.g. plastic bags, products like plastic bottles, sachets,
etc.)
3. Invest in reusable packaging and new delivery systems
4. Extended Producer Responsibility - Take full responsibility (social and environmental) and
demand the same of suppliers, for the entire lifecycle of the product and its packaging.
5. Increase transparency by measuring and reporting on plastic reduction and waste production
and undergoing audits.

Like any other campaign, it is important to learn (what has been successful elsewhere?), share
(social media, newsletters, emails), organize (and perhaps make a presentation to the
store management) and celebrate (shower kudos on the businesses that take steps to reduce
SUP)!
