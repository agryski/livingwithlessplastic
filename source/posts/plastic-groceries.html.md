##Plastic at the Grocery Store

Are you concerned about the amount of plastic you ‘buy’ when you do your grocery shopping?
Produce in plastic wrap, bread in plastic bags, dairy products in plastic tubs, meat on black
plastic trays? You already take your cloth shopping bags &amp; produce bags. You already choose
products that have less packaging. However, there is a limit to the options you have if your
grocery store doesn’t stock many ‘plastic-free’ products.
We know that non-plastic packaging options exist (cardboard, paper, plant-based wrapping
film, using reusable containers). We know that grocery stores can ask their suppliers to use the
greener options. Here are some things that can be done:
1) Contact the chain’s head office
2) Share the names of ‘green’ grocery stores
3) Let the stockers and the cashier know that we are looking for ‘less packaging’
options
4) follow Zero Waste Canada
5) support farmers markets and local producers
6) use fewer prepared foods by making our own versions
